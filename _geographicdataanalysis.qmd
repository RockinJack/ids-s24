 ## Introduction  
 Hello! My name is Jack Dennison and I am a junior dual Applied Data Analysis and Geographic Information 
 systems major. I am interested in the intersection of geography and statistics, so this presentation 
 reflects that. Therefore, I'm going to talk about the various ways that Geographic Data Analysis can be 
 done using python. Some examples things that will be disussed are `geopandas` and `geopy`.
