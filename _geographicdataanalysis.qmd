 ## Introduction  
 Hello! My name is Jack Dennison and I am a junior dual Applied Data Analysis and Geographic Information 
 systems major. I am interested in the intersection of geography and statistics, so this presentation 
 reflects that. Therefore, I'm going to talk about the various ways that Geographic Data Analysis can be 
 done using python. Some examples of things that will be disussed are `geopy`, `geopandas`, and `arcpy`.

 ## Downloading the Necessary Packages
 In order to download GeoPy, you can simply install it using either Conda or pip commands.
 Using Conda:
 `conda install geopy`
 
 Using pip:
 `pip install geopy`
 
 To install GeoPandas, it's recommended that you first download prerequisite packages, such as NumPy, 
 pandas, shapely, and Fiona. After that, you can use Conda or pip to install GeoPandas.

 Using Conda:
 `conda install numpy pandas shapely Fiona`
 `conda install geopandas`

 Using pip:
 `pip install numpy pandas shapely Fiona`
 `pip install geopandas`
