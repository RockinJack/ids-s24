        " Hello! My name is Jack Dennison and I am a junior dual Applied Data Analysis and Geographic Information \n",
        " systems major. I am interested in the intersection of geography and statistics, so this presentation \n",
        " reflects that. Therefore, I'm going to talk about the various ways that Geographic Data Analysis can be \n",
        " done using python. Some examples of things that will be disussed are `geopy`, `geopandas`, and `arcpy`.\n",

        " ## Downloading the Necessary Packages\n",
        " In order to download GeoPy, you can simply install it using either Conda or pip commands.\n",
        " Using Conda:\n",
        " `conda install geopy`\n",

        " \n",
        " To install GeoPandas, it's recommended that you first download prerequisite packages, such as NumPy, \n",
        " pandas, shapely, and Fiona. After that, you can use Conda or pip to install GeoPandas.\n",

        " ## GeoPy Overview\n",
        " GeoPy is a powerful Python library that provides geocoding capabilities and various geospatial \n",
        " utilities. It allows users to perform various tasks related to geographical information, including \n",
        " geocoding, reverse geocoding, distance calculations, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### Geocoding\n",
        " GeoPy can be used to geocode, which is to turn addresses into locations on the coordinate system plane. For \n",
        " example, take an address from the Rodent Data Spreadsheet.\n",

        " * 265 Putnam Avenue, Brooklyn, New York\n",
        "\n",

        " this address, as follows.\n"

        " ### Reverse Geocoding\n",
        " Similarly to how we can use GeoPy to geocode a coordinate based off of an address, we can also do this\n",
        " in reverse: take an address from a lattitude and longitude. Let's again take two coordinates from "
