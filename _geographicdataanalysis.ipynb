        " ## Introduction  \n",
        " Hello! My name is Jack Dennison and I am a junior dual Applied Data Analysis and Geographic Information \n",
        " systems major. I am interested in the intersection of geography and statistics, so this presentation \n",
        " reflects that. Therefore, I'm going to talk about the various ways that Geographic Data Analysis can be \n",
        " done using python. Some examples of things that will be disussed are `geopy`, `geopandas`, and `arcpy`.\n",
        "\n",
        " ## Downloading the Necessary Packages\n",
        " In order to download GeoPy, you can simply install it using either Conda or pip commands.\n",
        " Using Conda:\n",
        " ```bash\n",
        " `conda install geopy`\n",
        " ```\n",
        " Using pip:\n",
        " ```bash\n",
        " `pip install geopy`\n",
        " ```\n",
        " \n",
        " To install GeoPandas, it's recommended that you first download prerequisite packages, such as NumPy, \n",
        " pandas, shapely, and Fiona. After that, you can use Conda or pip to install GeoPandas.\n",
        "\n",
        " Using Conda:\n",
        " ```bash\n",
        " `conda install numpy pandas shapely Fiona`\n",
        " `conda install geopandas`\n",
        " ```\n",

        " ## GeoPy Overview\n",
        " GeoPy is a powerful Python library that provides geocoding capabilities and various geospatial \n",

        " geocoding, reverse geocoding, distance calculations, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### Geocoding\n",
        " GeoPy can be used to geocode, which is to turn addresses into locations on the coordinate system plane. \n",
        " For example, take an address from the Rodent Data Spreadsheet.\n",
        "\n",
        " * 265 Putnam Avenue, Brooklyn, New York\n",
        "\n",
        " Using the Nominatim encoder from OpenStreetMap, we can geocode to find the lattitude and longitude of \n",
        " this address. Before going through with this, it should be noted that the rodent data file does give\n",
        " the latitude and longitude of every rodent incident, so this will be used to check work. The coordinates\n",
        " given by the data are as follows: (40.683855196486164, -73.95164557951071). Let's see if we can \n",
        " replicate this with geopy.\n"

        " ### Distance Mapping\n",
        " Geopy can also be used to map distances between locations. To exemplify this, let's use the two \n",
        " coordinates from the previous two examples. We will be calculating the distance using the Haversine \n",
        " formula, which is a method to compute distances between two points on a sphere.\n",

        "point2 = (40.77924175816874, -73.95368859796383)  # Point from reverse geocoding example\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calculate the distance between the two points using the Haversine formula\n",
        "distance_haversine = distance(point1, point2).miles  # You can also use kilometers by calling .kilometers\n",
        "\n",
        "# Print the result\n",
        "print(\"Distance between New York City and Los Angeles (Haversine formula): {:.2f} miles\".format(distance_haversine))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " Here is the output: \n",
        " Distance between New York City and Los Angeles (Haversine formula): 6.58 miles\n",
        "\n",
        " This is an effective method to look at the distance between two points on earth. While the two locations\n",
        " in New York are rather close to each other, this method works regardless of the locations of the points.\n",
